\begin{exercise}[Galois connections]
  A \emph{partially ordered set}, or short \emph{poset}, is a set $A$ equipped with a reflexive, transitive and antisymmetric relation $≤$.
  A map $f:A → B$ between partially ordered sets is \emph{order preserving} if $a ≤_A a'$ implies $f(a) ≤_B f(a')$.

  A \emph{Galois connection} between two partially ordered sets is a pair of order preserving maps $g:(B,≤_B) ⇆ (A,≤_A):f$ which satisfies the following \emph{adjunction property} for all $a ∈ A$, $b ∈ B$:
  $$
  f(a) ≤_B b \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad a ≤_A g(b)
  $$
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Let $X$, $Y$ be sets and $⊥ ⊆ X × Y$ a relation from $X$ to $Y$.
      Prove that the following maps form a Galois connection between the power sets of $X$ and $Y$.
      \begin{align*}
        𝒱_R : (𝒫(X),⊇) &\leftrightarrows (𝒫(Y),⊆) : ℐ_R\\
        S & \longmapsto \{y ∈ Y \mid ∀s ∈ S:s \perp y\}\\
        \{x ∈ X \mid ∀t ∈ T:x \perp t\} & \longmapsfrom T
      \end{align*}
      {\scriptsize Note that $≤_A$ is the subset relation $⊆$ and $≤_B$ the reverse subset relation $⊇$, making order preserving maps between the two powersets \emph{inclusion reversing}.}
    \item Let $K$ be a field.
      Show the existence of a Galois connection
      $$
      𝒱:(𝒫(K[x_1,\dots,x_n]),⊇) ⇆ (𝒫(𝔸^n_K),⊆):ℐ
      $$
      between the power sets of the polynomial ring $K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ and the affine space $𝔸^n_K$, such that $𝒱(S)$ is the vanishing set of $S⊆K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ and $ℐ(T)$ the vanishing ideal of $T⊆𝔸^n_K$.
    \item Let $\Idl(R)$ denote the set of ideals of a commutative ring $R$.
      Show that $ℐ(T)$ is an ideal for every $T⊆𝔸^n_K$ and conclude that the above Galois connection descends to a Galois connection $𝒱:(\Idl(K[x_1,\dots,x_n]),⊇) ⇆ (𝒫(𝔸^n_K),⊆):ℐ$.
    \item Let $\Rad(R)$ denote the set of radical ideals of a commutative ring $R$.
      Show that $ℐ(T)$ is radical for every $T⊆𝔸^n_K$ and conclude that the above Galois connection descends to a Galois connection $𝒱:(\Rad(K[x_1,\dots,x_n]),⊇) ⇆ (𝒫(𝔸^n_K),⊆):ℐ$.\\
      {\scriptsize An ideal $𝖆 ⊆ R$ is \emph{radical} if $∀f ∈ R : (∃n ∈ ℕ : f^n ∈ 𝖆) ⇒ f ∈ 𝖆$.}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}[Closure operators]
  A \emph{closure operator} on a poset $A$ is an order preserving map $◯:A → A$ which is \emph{idempotent}, $◯(◯(a)) = ◯(a)$, and \emph{extensive}, $a ≤ ◯(a)$.

  Let $g:B ⇆ A:f$ be a Galois connection.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that $g∘f$ is a closure operator on $(A,≤_A)$.
    \item Show that $f∘g$ is a closure operator on $(B,≥_B)$.
      {\scriptsize Mind the reverse ordering!}
  \end{enumerate}
  Let $R$ be a commutative ring.
  Prove that the following maps are closure operators.
  \begin{enumerate}[start=3]
    \item The map $(\_):𝒫(R) → 𝒫(R)$ sending a subset $S⊆R$ to the ideal it generates. 
      $$
      (S)\coloneqq \{r_1s_1 + \dots + r_ns_n \mid n ∈ ℕ,\, r_i ∈ R,\, s_i ∈ S\}
      $$
    \item The map $\sqrt{-}:\Idl(R) → \Idl(R)$ sending an ideal $𝖆⊆R$ to its radical.
      $$
      \sqrt{𝖆}\coloneqq\{r ∈ R \mid ∃n ∈ ℕ : r^n ∈ 𝖆\}
      $$
  \end{enumerate}
  Let $K$ be a field.
  Prove:
  \begin{enumerate}[start=5]
    \item $𝒱((S))=𝒱(S)$ for every subset $S⊆K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$.
    \item $𝒱(\sqrt{I})=𝒱(I)$ for every ideal $I⊆K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}[Galois correspondences]
  A Galois connection $g:B ⇆ A:f$ is a \emph{Galois correspondence} if $f$ and $g$ are mutual inverses.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that a Galois connection induces a Galois correspondence between the the sets of fixed points of its associated closure operators.
      \begin{equation*}
        \begin{tikzcd}
          (\Fix(f∘g),≤_B)
          \arrow[r,yshift=-2.5,"g"']
          & (\Fix(g∘f),≤_A)
          \arrow[l,yshift=2.5,"f"', "\sim" yshift=0.5pt]
        \end{tikzcd}
      \end{equation*}
      {\scriptsize A fixed point of an endomap $s:X → X$ is an element $x ∈ X$ with $s(x)=x$.}
  \end{enumerate}
  Let $K$ be an algebraically closed field.
  \begin{enumerate}[start=2]
    \item Find a Galois correspondence between the radical ideals of $K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ and the affine varieties in $𝔸^n_K$.
      {\scriptsize Use Hilbert's Nullstellensatz.}
    \item Show that this Galois correspondence restricts to a Galois correspondence between the maximal ideals of $K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ and the points in $𝔸^n_K$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}[Joins and meets]
  Let $(A,≤)$ be a poset and $M⊆A$.
  An upper bound $a ∈ A$ of $M$ (that is, $m ≤ a$ for all $m ∈ M$) is called a \emph{join} or \emph{supremum} of $M$ if it satisfies the following universal property:
  $$
  ∀a' ∈ A: (∀m ∈ M:m ≤ a') ⇒ a ≤ a'
  $$
  Dually $a$ is a \emph{meet} or \emph{infimum} of $M$ if it is a join of $M$ in the poset $(A,≥)$ with reverse ordering.
  If each finite subset has a join and a meet, $A$ is called a \emph{lattice}.
  If this holds for all subsets, the lattice is said to be \emph{complete}.

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that meets and joins are unique if they exist.  In case of existence, write $⋁ M$ for the join of $M$ and $⋀ M$ for its meet.
    \item Show that the following are equivalent for a lattice $A$:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item $A$ is complete.
        \item Every subset of $A$ has a meet.
        \item Every subset of $A$ has a join.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item Let $◯:A → A$ be a closure operator on a poset $(A,≤)$.
    Let $M⊆\Fix(◯)$ and regard $\Fix(◯)$ as a subposet of $(A,≤)$.
      Prove:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item A meet of $M$ in $A$ is a fixed point of $◯$.
          Moreover, it is the meet of $M$ in $\Fix(◯)$.
        \item If $M$ has a join in $A$, its image under $◯$ is the join of $M$ in $\Fix(◯)$.
        \item Deduce that $\Fix(◯)$ is a complete lattice if $A$ is.
        \item Prove that $◯(a) = ⋀ \{m ∈ \Fix(◯) \mid a ≤ m\}$ for all $a ∈ A$.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item Compute meet and join of
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item a set $M⊆𝒫(X)$ of subsets of a set $X$,
        \item a set $M⊆\Idl(R)$ of ideals of a commutative ring $R$,
        \item a set $M⊆\Rad(R)$ of radical ideals of a commutative ring $R$,
      \end{enumerate}
      and conclude that $𝒫(X)$, $\Idl(X)$ and $\Rad(X)$ are complete lattices.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}[Lattice homomorphisms]
  Let $g:B ⇆ A:f$ be a Galois connection.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that $g$ preserves meets and $f$ preserves joins, that is, for every $M⊆B$ and $N⊆A$ we have
      \begin{equation*}
        g \left( ⋀ M \right) = ⋀ g(M),\qquad f \left( ⋁ M \right) = ⋁ f(M).
      \end{equation*}
    \item Suppose the Galois connection is a Galois correspondence.
      Show that both maps are complete lattice homomorphisms.
    \item Let $K$ be a field.
      Conclude that
      $$
        𝒱(∑𝖆_i) = 𝒱(⋃𝖆_i) = ⋂𝒱(𝖆_i), \qquad ℐ(⋃T_i) = ⋂ℐ(T_i),
      $$
      where $(𝖆_i)_{i ∈ I}$ is family of ideals $𝖆_i⊆K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ and $(T_i)_{i ∈ I}$ is a family of subsets $T_i⊆𝔸^n_K$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}[Ideal operations]
  Let $R$ be a commutative ring and $𝖆,𝖇,𝖈⊆R$ ideals.
  Recall the definition of the \emph{ideal sum}
  $$
  𝖆 + 𝖇 \coloneqq (𝖆 ∪ 𝖇),
  $$
  the \emph{ideal product}
  $$
  𝖆 ⋅ 𝖇 \coloneqq (\{a ⋅ b ∈ R\mid a ∈ 𝖆, b ∈ 𝖇\}),
  $$
  and the \emph{ideal quotient}
  $$
  𝖆 : 𝖇 \coloneqq \{r ∈ R \mid r ⋅ 𝖇 ⊆ 𝖆\}.
  $$
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that $𝖆 ∩ 𝖇$ is an ideal but $𝖆 ∪ 𝖇$ is not in general.
    \item Show that $𝖆 : 𝖇$ is an ideal but $\{a ⋅ b ∈ R \mid a ∈ 𝖆, b ∈ 𝖇\}$ is not in general.
    \item Prove the \emph{distributive law} $𝖆⋅(𝖇 + 𝖈) = 𝖆⋅𝖇 + 𝖆⋅𝖈$ and the \emph{modular law} $𝖆∩(𝖇 + 𝖈) = 𝖆∩𝖇 + 𝖆∩𝖈$.
    \item Show that the following inclusions hold
      $$
      𝖆 ⋅ 𝖇 ⊆ 𝖆 ∩ 𝖇 ⊆ 𝖆 ∪ 𝖇 ⊆ 𝖆 + 𝖇,
      $$
      and find a counterexample for each reverse inclusion.
    \item Show the following laws for the ideal quotient, where $𝖆_i$ is a family of ideals.
      \begin{multicols}{2}
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item $𝖆 ⊆ 𝖆 : 𝖇$
          \item $(𝖆 : 𝖇) ⋅ 𝖇 ⊆ 𝖆 $
          \item $(𝖆 : 𝖇) : 𝖈 = 𝖆 : (𝖇⋅𝖈) = (𝖆 : 𝖇) : 𝖈$
          \item 
        \end{enumerate}
      \end{multicols}
